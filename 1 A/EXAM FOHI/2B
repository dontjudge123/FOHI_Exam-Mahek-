To make DICOM metadata interoperable using FHIR:

Use FHIR APIs to expose DICOM metadata in a standardized way.
Utilize the FHIR ImagingStudy resource to represent imaging studies, including DICOM-specific metadata.
Consider using custom FHIR extensions to capture additional DICOM-specific metadata.
Leverage DICOMWeb, a RESTful web API standard, for FHIR-compatible access and retrieval of DICOM data.
Map DICOM metadata to FHIR resources using libraries like fhir.resources and pydicom.
Consider using DICOMWeb client libraries to facilitate integration between DICOM and FHIR.
These approaches enable interoperability, allowing other systems to interact with DICOM data using FHIR resources and operations
